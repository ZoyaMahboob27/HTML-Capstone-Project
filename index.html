      of levels for 2D platformer games, and, my internships at GrayHat and
      USquare Solutions, followed by a contract-based job at USquare Solutions

    <ul>
      <li>
        My final year project focused on the automation of level generation for

        It is a plug-in in Unity targeted towards developers with six biomes,
        out of which two were made by me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developers can choose from different metrics such as noise generation
        algorithms, biome parameters (size and type), and in-built textures to
        generate 2D levels.

        (in the case of companies) pay for quests made.
      </li>
      <li>
        The website was connected to a mobile app developed in Unity that made
        use of the Google Maps API to access live locations. Any changes made on
        the website were reflected in the mobile app as well.
